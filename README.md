# ShaderToy

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SimonDanisch/ShaderToy.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SimonDanisch/ShaderToy.jl)

This is [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) recreated with [GLVisualize.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGL/GLVisualize.jl)


Seems its fine if I just grab examples from ShaderToy, as long as their license permits it. If not, please notify me!
